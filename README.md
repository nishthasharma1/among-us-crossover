# Getting Started

1. (Optional) Watch the beginner's guide video (see references above) for an overview. 

1. Some other important things to know about ML...

  Machine learning libraries:
  - Tensorflow is a well-known open source ML library from Google, for python language.
  - tf.js is Tensorflow for javascript developers. But a better beginner starting point is...
  - ML5.js, a javascript library that aims to make ML approachable, from a learning perspective as well as a cost perspective.
  - Teachable Machine, from Google, building off all of the above and making a user-friendly UI for training models.
  
  Machine learning as a field:
  - ML can be very powerful, handling tasks with more ambiguity such as interpreting handwriting, recognizing faces, etc.
  - ML is generally quite costly since it has to do an incredible number of calculations, sometimes requiring expensive GPUs.
  - ML is being increasingly used in many aspects of life, from captcha to facial recognition, and there are many ethical considerations to this.
  
1. Get started watching the tutorial video [Teachable Machine 1: Image Classification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwcillcWOg0). Remix current project for starter code, it's basically the "Code Template".
  1. Find 3-4 objects around your house that are easy to hold and that you will map to emojis.
  1. Go to [Teachable Machine website](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and choose image project, standard image model.
  1. Make a class for every object you have and use webcam option to upload about 50-100 images of your object in different positions. Move it around, rotate it, get different angels!
  1. Train the model (DO NOT LEAVE TAB) and test to see if it's working well. If not, recollect data and re-train.
  1. Export Model > Tensorflow.js > Upload (shareable link). Hit "Upload My Model" and get the shareable link!
  1. Come back to glitch, remix this project.
  1. Follow coding steps in video! There's also a final code link in the description if you are stuck.
  1. Feel free to play around and build off this or try some other ML5.js tutorials from The Coding Train!
